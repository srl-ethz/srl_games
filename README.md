# s(implified)rl_games
A simplified version of the excellent (but sometimes challenging to read through) [rl_games](https://github.com/Denys88/rl_games) library, forked from v1.6.0. The basic RL examples in IsaacGymEnvs should perform just the same, but some features like RNN, CNN, etc have been removed for clarity.
An assertion error should show up in case some feature is not implemented, but in some cases the program may still run but exhibit degraded performance due to some features being removed. Use at your own risk!
